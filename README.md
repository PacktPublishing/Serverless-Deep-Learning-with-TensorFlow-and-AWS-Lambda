# Serverless Deep Learning with TensorFlow and AWS Lambda [Video]
This is the code repository for [Serverless Deep Learning with TensorFlow and AWS Lambda [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/serverless-deep-learning-tensorflow-and-aws-lambda-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789618679), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
One of the main problems with deep learning models is finding the right way to deploy them within the company's IT infrastructure. Serverless architecture changes the rules of the gameâ€”instead of thinking about cluster management, scalability, and query processing, it allows us to focus specifically on training the model. This course prepares you to use your own custom-trained models with AWS Lambda to achieve a simplified serverless computing approach without spending much time and money. You will use AWS services to deploy TensorFlow models without spending hours training them. You'll learn to deploy with serverless infrastructures, create APIs, process pipelines, and more. By the end of the course, you will have implemented a project that demonstrates using AWS Lambda to serve TensorFlow models.
